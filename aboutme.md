### Jake's Steaks

American classics are built on a simple foundation: meat and cheese. While there are numerous ways to combine the aforementioned delicacies, few ways are quite as unctuous and satisfying as the Philly Cheesesteak. Typically found on the East Coast, Jake's Steaks brings the molten sub to the Marina District of San Francisco. If you're around, I'd recommend the wiz or the white american. A good cheesesteak deserves some serious cheese meltage


### Buffalo Bills

At times, one must walk by faith, not by sight. There's no better way to experience these words than through life as a Bills fan. The Buffalo faithful have been pushed to the brink, experiencing both heartbreak for the team and the city over the franchises 60+ history in Western New York. Despite all of this, the fans haven't blinked. The poet Albert Camus may accurate sum the experience: 

> “In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer. And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there’s something stronger – something better, pushing right back.”


### Stanford Football

To be sure, we are in the doldrums of both the Pac 12 and Stanford Football. However, it was not too long ago that the Stanford Cardinal were at the bottom of the list of teams that anyone would want to play. Jim Harbaugh's revolution saw the team go from cellar dwellars to perennial BCS attendees. Prolific running back play from the likes of Bryce Love, Toby Gerhart and Christian McCaffrey were complimented by elite Quarterback play from Kevin Hogan and Andrew Luck. High caliber trenchmen were on both sides of the ball and their defense was known for being as stingy as they come. Perhaps most impressively, Stanford has had an indominable spirit when faced with the tallest of odds. No game moreso embodies this than their 2007 trip to the City of Angels
